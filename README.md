### Biggest Improvements to Site
I made several significant changes to the site to enhance the overall user experience, improve performance, and ensure a responsive design. Firstly, I replaced the theme switcher with a toggle switch instead of two separate buttons, making it more intuitive and reducing clutter. Secondly, I added dynamic JavaScript linking for pages that require JavaScript and those that do not, optimizing page load times and enhancing performance. Lastly, I finalized and cleaned up the media queries for three device sizes (phone, tablet, computer), ensuring a consistent and responsive design across different devices.
