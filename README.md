### Biggest Improvements to Site
*Summary:*
I made several significant changes to the site to enhance the overall user experience, improve performance, and ensure a responsive design. Firstly, I replaced the theme switcher with a toggle switch instead of two separate buttons, making it more intuitive and reducing clutter. Secondly, I added dynamic JavaScript linking for pages that require JavaScript and those that do not, optimizing page load times and enhancing performance. Lastly, I finalized and cleaned up the media queries for three device sizes (phone, tablet, computer), ensuring a consistent and responsive design across different devices.

1. Theme Switcher:
- changed toggle from light to dark from two buttons into a toggle/sliding switch for clearer indication of active theme (light/dark)
- Removed multiple accent colors per current theme. Decreases cognitiveload for user to set custom accent colors for each theme

2. Dyanmic JavaScript options
- Added page defaults that dont require javascript to be enabled such as the no-js contact form and the project section that does not include custom elements.

3. Adjusted media queries
- Finalized media queries for all pages that adapt properly two 3 device types: phone tablet and desktop.
